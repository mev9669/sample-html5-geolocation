This HTML5 application was built using the Geolocation and Canvas application 
programming interface (API) of the HTML5 W3C specification.  This app relies on 
JavaScript and HTML source code to create the user interface. The sample uses 
geolocation data as a mechanism in which rendering of graphics onto a canvas 
element takes place based on the indicated relative location.  A predefined 
target location, in the form of latitude and longitude, is stored in the code 
and compared to the userâ€™s current location also in degrees of latitude and 
longitude to determine whether the user is near to the proposed coordinates. 
The center rings become colored based on the distance the user is from the 
target location. The innermost ring becomes red if the user is within 0 to 
4 miles of the targeted longitude and latitude. The middle ring becomes orange 
if the user is within 5 to 8 miles of the targeted longitude and latitude. The 
outer ring becomes yellow if the user is greater than 8 miles of the targeted 
longitude and latitude. The distance away from the targeted location is also 
presented based on the latitude and longitude coordinates.
 
It was ported to work with PhoneGap* on Android* and iOS*.
