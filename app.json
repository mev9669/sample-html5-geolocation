  "description": "This HTML5 application was built using the Geolocation and Canvas application programming interface (API) of the HTML5 W3C specification.  The sample uses geolocation data as a mechanism in which rendering of graphics onto a canvas element takes place based on the indicated relative location.  A predefined target location, in the form of latitude and longitude, is stored in the code and compared to the userâ€™s current location also in degrees of latitude and longitude to determine whether the user is near to the proposed coordinates.",
