This HTML5 application was built using the Geolocation and Canvas application programming interface (API) of the HTML5 W3C specification.  This app relies on JavaScript and HTML source code to create the user interface. The sample uses geolocation data as a mechanism in which rendering of graphics onto a canvas element takes place based on the indicated relative location.  A predefined target location, in the form of latitude and longitude, is stored in the code and compared to the userâ€™s current location also in degrees of latitude and longitude to determine whether the user is near to the proposed coordinates.
